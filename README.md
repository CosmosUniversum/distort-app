# Distort

## Objective 
+ Build a full stack single page suggestion application where the user is able to accumulate lists of movies, music, and podcasts.
+ Users will be able to input an initial query of a movie, music, or podcast and get a list of suggestions from that same category.
+ Users will be able to add returned suggestions to their respective collection lists.
+ Users will be able to look at other suggestion lists created by other users on the application and follow them. 
+ Users will be able to rate and review suggestions on their profile.
+ Users will be able to update their collection lists.

## Motivation
Most people usually listen to suggestions made by others to go by in life. These suggestions are most often given to reflect the existing interests one might have. Suggesstions are distortions of an original idea. Based off of this idea, we introduce our app Distort.
